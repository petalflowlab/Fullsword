## Safety Rules

- **NEVER** run `git clean -fd` or `git reset --hard` without checking `git log` and verifying commits exist.
- **NEVER** delete untracked files or folders blindly. Always backup or stash before bulk edits.

## Quick Reference
- 19 warnings → see `.agent-mem/gotchas.md`
- 28 conventions → see `.agent-mem/patterns.md`
- Codebase map → see `.agent-mem/project-brief.md`
- Active work → see `.agent-mem/active-context.md`

## Read .agent-mem/gotchas.md before ANY changes

For full memory: `.agent-mem/`
For observation details: `.agent-mem/observations/`

## Available Tools (Use ON-DEMAND only — context in .agent-mem replaces startup calls)
- `smart_save(title, content, category)` — Save + auto-detect conflicts
- `batch_save(items[])` — Save multiple in 1 call
- `query(q)` — Search memory when debugging
- `find(query)` — Full-text search for details
- `errors()` — Check compiler errors after edits
- `read_lines(path, start, end)` — Read file sections
- `grep(pattern, dir)` — Find symbols without loading full files

> Do NOT call load() or warnings() at startup — read the .agent-mem files above instead.

## Safety — Never Run Destructive Commands

> Dangerous commands are actively monitored.
> Critical/high risk commands trigger error notifications in real-time.

- **NEVER** run `rm -rf`, `del /s`, `rmdir`, `format`, or any command that deletes files/directories without EXPLICIT user approval.
- **NEVER** run `DROP TABLE`, `DELETE FROM`, `TRUNCATE`, or any destructive database operation.
- **NEVER** run `git push --force`, `git reset --hard`, or any command that rewrites history.
- **NEVER** run `npm publish`, `docker rm`, `terraform destroy`, or any irreversible deployment/infrastructure command.
- **NEVER** pipe remote scripts to shell (`curl | bash`, `wget | sh`).
- **ALWAYS** ask the user before running commands that modify system state, install packages, or make network requests.
- When in doubt, **show the command first** and wait for approval.

**Stack:** Unknown stack

## 📝 NOTE: 1 uncommitted file(s) in working tree.\n\n## Project Standards

- convention in .gitignore
- Version your API from day 1 (/api/v1/)
- Use consistent response format across all endpoints
- Implement soft delete for important data — don't hard delete without confirmation
- Handle timezone correctly — store UTC, display in user's timezone
- Make layouts responsive from the start — mobile-first approach
- Disable submit button during form submission — prevent double-submit
- Always add empty states ("No items yet" with call-to-action)

## Verified Best Practices

- Agent generates new migration for every change (squash related changes)
- Agent installs packages without checking if already installed

## Available Tools (ON-DEMAND only)
- `query(q)` — Deep search when stuck
- `find(query)` — Full-text lookup
> Context above IS your context. Do NOT call load() at startup.
